# Hello-World-App-on-React

Yes! I developed my first React App "Hello World" using node.js and npm which can run on my computer through the local address.

The project was created using react components such as Vite, tailwind, postcss, and .gitigore This ensured that the project structure followed best practices.

The source folder was also incorporated to ensure the project run effectively without any bug. In the source folder we have: App.Jsx, index.css and main.jsx to structure the syntax effectively and to demonstarte my ability to use basic react fundamentals to render the message "Hello World!" in the web browser.

The semantic HTML element of "h1" was equally used to render the message "Hello World!" in the web browser

To run the project on VSCode, followed the following Terminal prompt:

PS C:\Users\ADMIN\Documents\3MTT\React\dist\index.html> npm run start

Alternatively, you can open the dist\index.html file directly in your browser to render the "Hello World!" message on your browser.
